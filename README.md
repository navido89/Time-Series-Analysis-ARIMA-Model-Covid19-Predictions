# Predicting number of Covid19 deaths using Time Series Analysis (ARIMA MODEL) 

In this project, a Time Series Analysis (ARIMA Model) predicts the number of deaths in the United States starting from August 1st – August 21st and August 1st – November 1st. The goal of this project was to compare our results with the projections that have been made by CNN. In addition to the comparison to CNN the aim was to get a deeper understanding of Time Series Analysis as well.
